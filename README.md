## MobX Clicker Game Engine

An education sandbox for exploring agent‑driven development. This engine provides a stable foundation, while the game settings in `docs/examples` act as creative prompts and structured cases for testing how AI agents and developers iterate, adapt, and extend ideas.

## Goals

- Provide a simple, reusable clicker‑game engine as the baseline.
- Encourage creativity and experimentation through curated example settings.
- Enable evaluation of agent capabilities: planning, iteration, and implementation.

## How to Use

- Start with a scenario from `docs/examples`.
- Use the engine as a scaffold for new mechanics, rules, or content.
- Compare different approaches (human vs. agent, or agent vs. agent) on the same setup.

## Who It’s For

- Developers learning agent‑assisted workflows.
- Researchers evaluating agent performance.
- Educators creating hands‑on exercises around agentic development.
