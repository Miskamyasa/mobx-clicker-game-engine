# Example Themes

Themed game content contracts and creative prompts for the engine. Each example defines a complete game setting: resource mappings, workers, levels, operations, and tone.

All examples share a common [Engine Mechanics Contract](./_mechanics-contract.md).

## Available Themes

| Theme | File | Core Fantasy |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Ocean Explorer | [ocean.md](./ocean.md) | Lead a marine research program into the deep sea |
| Lost Civilizations | [archaeology.md](./archaeology.md) | Excavate layers of a forgotten ancient site |
| Space Colony | [space-colony.md](./space-colony.md) | Establish humanity's first foothold on an alien world |

## Creating a New Theme

1. Copy any existing example as a template
2. Define your resource mapping (what `energy`, `output`, `reputation`, `money` mean in your theme)
3. Design 6 workers with progressive unlock conditions
4. Create 5 levels with 4 operations + 2 expeditions each
5. Define prestige framing (trigger, currency, bonuses)
6. Set tone and aesthetic direction

The mechanics contract stays the same across all themes. Only the flavor changes.
