# Space Colony: Exoplanet Survey

## Core Fantasy
You're a survey commander establishing humanity's first foothold on an alien world. Click to Scan, discover alien phenomena, and build your colony's reputation with the Galactic Federation to secure more funding and personnel.

## Engine Mechanics Contract

- Canonical resource keys: `energy`, `output`, `reputation`, `money`.
- Scan loop: spend `energy` to gain `output`.
- Operations consume resources (typically `output`, sometimes `energy`/`money`) and yield `reputation` plus optional rewards.
- Base mechanics: `docs/game-design-document.md`.

## Core Gameplay Loop

```
Crew → Power reserves → Scan → Mineral deposits located → Analysis → Galactic Federation standing → Credits → Crew
```

## Resource Mapping

| Engine | Theme | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| energy | **Power reserves** | Generated by crew and infrastructure, consumed by Scan actions |
| output | **Mineral deposits located** | Located via Scan clicks, spent to analyze anomalies |
| reputation | **Galactic Federation standing** | Earned from confirmed discoveries, attracts attention from HQ |
| money | **Credits** | Passive income from federation standing, used to hire crew and buy upgrades |

**Production notes:**
- Early crew: high energy, no data output
- Mid-tier: balanced energy + data
- Late-tier: massive energy + data generation

## Levels (Survey Zones)

### Level 0: Colony Perimeter
*The safe zone around base camp. Familiar terrain, low-risk discoveries.*

**Depth equivalent:** 0-200m (Sunlight Zone)

**Operations (Anomalies):**
- `strange-minerals` — Unusual rock formations with unknown properties
- `micro-organisms` — Tiny alien life in the soil samples
- `atmospheric-readings` — Peculiar gas compositions worth logging
- `ancient-erosion` — Weathering patterns suggesting liquid water history

**Expeditions:**
- `perimeter-sweep` — Basic survey of the surrounding area
- `sample-collection` — Gather materials for lab analysis

---

### Level 1: Wilderness Frontier
*Beyond the fence. Dense alien flora, unpredictable fauna signatures.*

**Depth equivalent:** 200-1000m (Twilight Zone)

**Operations (Anomalies):**
- `bioluminescent-flora` — Plants that glow in the planet's long nights
- `hive-structures` — Insectoid constructions of unknown origin
- `magnetic-anomaly` — Localized fields disrupting equipment
- `fossil-beds` — Preserved remains of ancient megafauna

**Expeditions:**
- `flora-cataloging` — Document the alien plant ecosystem
- `wildlife-tracking` — Follow creature migration patterns

---

### Level 2: Cavern Networks
*Underground systems stretching for kilometers. Echoes of something larger.*

**Depth equivalent:** 1000-4000m (Midnight Zone)

**Operations (Anomalies):**
- `crystal-caves` — Massive formations with energy-reactive properties
- `subterranean-lake` — Underground reservoirs with unknown life
- `thermal-vents` — Geothermal activity supporting unique ecosystems
- `echo-signatures` — Sounds suggesting massive underground chambers

**Expeditions:**
- `deep-mapping` — Chart the cavern topology
- `acoustic-analysis` — Investigate the mysterious echoes

---

### Level 3: Alien Ruins
*Undeniable evidence of prior intelligence. Structures too precise to be natural.*

**Depth equivalent:** 4000-6000m (Abyssal Zone)

**Operations (Anomalies):**
- `carved-monoliths` — Towering stones with geometric precision
- `power-conduits` — Still-functioning energy distribution networks
- `data-cores` — Storage devices containing unknown information
- `stasis-chambers` — Preservation units of uncertain contents

**Expeditions:**
- `ruin-excavation` — Careful extraction of artifacts
- `translation-attempts` — Decode alien inscriptions

---

### Level 4: Planet Core Access
*A shaft descending impossibly deep. The ruins were just the entrance.*

**Depth equivalent:** 6000-11000m (Hadal Zone)

**Operations (Anomalies):**
- `gravity-wells` — Localized distortions defying physics
- `living-machinery` — Technology that appears to be organic
- `temporal-echoes` — Glimpses of events that haven't happened
- `the-signal` — A transmission. Waiting. Aware.

**Expeditions:**
- `core-descent` — Journey to the planet's heart
- `first-contact` — Answer the signal

---

## Prestige Framing

**Trigger:** "Mission Recall" — Federation orders a full reset to establish a new colony on a different continent/planet.

**Currency:** "Survey Commendations" — Permanent recognition of your achievements.

**Bonuses:** Faster startup, better initial crew, reduced research costs, unlocked shortcuts.

---

## Tone & Aesthetic

- **Mood:** Hopeful frontier exploration with creeping cosmic dread
- **Progression arc:** "We're pioneers" → "We're not alone" → "We were invited"
- **Visual palette:** Dusty oranges and teals, alien bioluminescence, brutalist colony architecture
- **Audio cues:** Radio static, distant machinery, wind across empty plains
